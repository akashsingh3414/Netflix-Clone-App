Netflix Clone App
This project is built with Create React App and utilizes Redux for state management. Follow the steps below to set up and start using the app.


Prerequisites:
1. Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
2. A Google Firebase project.


Setup

Step 1: Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name



Step 2: Install Dependencies
npm install



Step 3: Configure Firebase
Go to Google Firebase and create a new project.
Obtain the Firebase configuration details: apiKey, authDomain, projectId, storageBucket, messagingSenderId, and appId.
Replace the placeholders in hooks/firebase.js with your Firebase project details.

// hooks/firebase.js
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "your-api-key",
  authDomain: "your-auth-domain",
  projectId: "your-project-id",
  storageBucket: "your-storage-bucket",
  messagingSenderId: "your-messaging-sender-id",
  appId: "your-app-id"
};
firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);



Step 4: Start the Development Server
npm start
Open http://localhost:3000 to view the app in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes.

Available Scripts
npm start
Runs the app in development mode.

npm test
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. See the running tests documentation for more information.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

npm run eject
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back! This command will copy all the configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project, giving you full control over them.
