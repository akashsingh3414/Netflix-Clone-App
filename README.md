# Netflix Clone App

A Netflix Clone App built using **Create React App** and **Redux Toolkit** for state management.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** and **npm** installed on your machine.

## Setup

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
### Step 2: Install Dependencies
Copy code
npm install

### Step 3: Configure Redux Toolkit
No Firebase setup is required. Redux Toolkit manages the state. Make sure your Redux slices, actions, and store are set up correctly in the src/store directory.

### Step 4: Start the Development Server
Copy code
npm start
Open http://localhost:3000 to view the app in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes.

## Available Scripts
### npm start
Runs the app in development mode.

### npm test
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. See the running tests documentation for more information.

### npm run build
Builds the app for production in the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### npm run eject
Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back! This command will copy all the configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project, giving you full control over them.
